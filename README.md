It's just a little plugin I coded for coding practice.

It lets you revive other players in spectator mode (aka when they died in hardcore).
You have to be in any gamemode except Spectator to revive someone.

But it comes at a cost.
(Alternatively if you toggle with /revivetoggle method you will have to burn a totem to revive someone.)

The price for a revive can be set with
/reviveprice
It will take the Item and amount in your hand and set it as the price.
(The default price is 1 Nether Star.)

/ritualprice
It will take the 1 of the Item in your hand and set it as the price.
(The default is 1 Totem of Undying.)

/revive player
Let's you revive players and it will automatically remove the item price from your inventory.

/revivetoggle method/spawn/ritualname
method: Lets you toggle between a ritual to revive or the default command.
spawn: Lets you toggle between reviving at world spawn or at the most recent death spot
ritualname: Lets you toggle between allowing people to choose who to revive by renaming the item to that person's ign (Case-Sensitive) or reviving a random person using the ritual
